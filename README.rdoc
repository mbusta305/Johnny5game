In this repo I have created a simple guessing game.
It allows user to interact with the page, either selecting to play or not.
Based on the users choice the page will prompt the user with a question to select a number between 1 and 6.
I wrote a script that randomly selects a number between/including 1 and 6 each time the user plays, and then displays
if the user picked correctly or incorrectly.

Languages used are:

HTML
